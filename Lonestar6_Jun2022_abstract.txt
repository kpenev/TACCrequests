Tides play an important role in shaping exoplanet and binary star systems. The effects of tidal coupling are evident over the entire life cycle of binary stars and exoplanet systems, and have been suggested to play a key role in the formation of short period giant planets, ultra short period planets, and a wide range of satellite systems within the Solar System. In spite of the wide spread implications, there is limited understanding of the processes involved, and the strength of the tidal coupling they produce. The proposed investigation aims to provide systematic, consistent, and reliable measurements of tidal coupling over a broad range of parameters, directly usable to model the effect of tides for almost all known exoplanet systems.
